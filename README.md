# ce00 Review Exercise

This exercise is designed to review some of the object-oriented concepts from your introductory programming course.
If you have trouble implementing any of the methods or understanding any concepts in this exercise, your instructors
recommend thoroughly reviewing your introductory course materials and asking questions to fill in any gaps. All 
concepts in this exercise will be critical moving forward in 1302.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

* A strong understanding of Arrays, Classes and Ojects in the Java programming language.

## Getting Started

   1. Create a new Eclipse project titled `cs1302-ce00`. Note: this is the only time you will be using eclipse
   in this course.
   1. Download [Money.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce00/master/src/Money.java?token=AAO3LOUUAOUAYGTIDFUNWMK5LV3W2)
   1. Download [Wallet.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce00/master/src/Wallet.java?token=AAO3LORBTKJXSFFO2543XX25LV33W)
   1. Place both `Money.java` and `Wallet.java` in the `src` folder of your `cs1302-ce00` project folder.
   
## Getting Started

   1. Navigate to [API Documentation](www.omfgdogs.com).
   1. The `Money.java` class is fully implemented for you. Read through the API documentation to understand the
   methods that are available and how to use them.
   1. Your main job for this exercise is to implement `Wallet.java`. There are four unimplemented methods. However, 
   the signatures are provided for you. The comments in the API documentation contain detailed guidelines to follow 
   for implementation.
   1. Once you have implemented the methods, execute the `WalletDriver.java` class which contains a series of
   unit tests to thoroughly test your implementation.
