# ce00 Review Exercise

![Approved for: Spring 2024](https://img.shields.io/badge/Approved%20for-Spring%202024-blue)

## Honors Recitation Instructions

We will use the review exercise below to provide an example for our first recitation discussion. All
students are required to carefully review the provided starter code and come prepared to Wednesday's
recitation session with written answers to the following questions:

   1. How many instance variables are contained in the `Money` class? How can you identify an instance variable?
   1. How many instance variables are contained in the `Wallet` class? Can you think of any other instance variables
      that might make sense to add to the `Wallet` class?
   1. There are four unimplemented methods (2 methods, 2 constructors) in the `Wallet` class. What is the purpose
      of each of those methods?
   1. Watch the introductory video below. Which concept(s) are you most unfamiliar with from your prerequisite course?
   1. Look through the test cases in `WalletDriver.java`. Think of at least one additional test case that we could add
      to more thoroughly test our implementation of `Wallet.java`.

You are not required to write the code to complete this exercise before Wednesday, but you are certainly 
encouraged to do so.

## Review Exercise

This exercise is designed to review some of the object-oriented concepts from your introductory programming course.
If you have trouble implementing any of the methods or understanding any concepts in this exercise, your instructors
recommend thoroughly reviewing your introductory course materials and asking questions to fill in any gaps. 
**All concepts in this exercise will be critical moving forward in CSCI 1302.**

## Prerequisite Knowledge

* [CSCI 1302 Reference Variable Refresher](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/alsi/refresher/variables.md)
* A strong understanding of Arrays, Classes, and Objects in the Java programming language.

## Getting Started
      
   1. In your IDE of choice, create a project called `cs1302-ce00`. 
   1. Download [Money.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce00/master/src/Money.java)
   1. Download [Wallet.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce00/master/src/Wallet.java)
   1. Download [WalletDriver.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce00/master/src/WalletDriver.java)
   1. Place `Money.java`, `Wallet.java`, and `WalletDriver.java` in the `src` folder of your `cs1302-ce00` project folder.

## Introductory Video

1. You might find the following introductory video helpful for getting started with the exercise. Please note that this video
   was created with an older version of this assignment. However, all of the concepts are still relevant.

## Exercise Steps

   1. Navigate to [API Documentation](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~cs1302a/cs1302-ce00-doc/).
   1. The `Money.java` class is fully implemented for you. Read through the API documentation on the
      API documentation website to understand the available methods and how to use them.
   1. Your main job for this exercise is to implement `Wallet.java`. There are four unimplemented methods. 
      However, the signatures are provided for you. The comments in the API documentation contain detailed 
      guidelines that you should follow for implementation. **You should read all of the comments before
      writing any code.**
   1. Once you have implemented the methods, execute the `WalletDriver.java` class which contains 
      a series of unit tests to thoroughly test your implementation. If you do not pass a test, then
      inspect the test to see what it's doing, and then try to fix your code.
